	<div style="margin: 25px 25%; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
		Based on the overall IMO framework, the 21 Baltic and North-East Atlantic coastal states and EU have developed and agreed in 2013 on a detailed joint harmonised procedure (<a href="https://helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/HELCOM-OSPAR-Joint-Harmonized-Procedure-for-BWMC-A-4-exemptions_2020.pdf" target="_blank">JHP</a>) to define “low risk” routes, as well as other necessary steps in granting exemptions under regulation A-4 of the IMO Ballast Water Management Convention (<a href="http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-the-Control-and-Management-of-Ships'-Ballast-Water-and-Sediments-(BWM).aspx" target="_blank">BWMC</a>). This has been done as a joint venture between the two regional seas commissions <a href="http://www.helcom.fi/" target="_blank">HELCOM</a> and <a href="http://www.ospar.org/" target="_blank">OSPAR</a>.

	<div style="margin: 25px 25%; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
		The entry into force in September 2017 of the IMO BWMC requires ships in international traffic to apply ballast water management measures, such as ballast water exchange (D-1) or to fulfil a certain discharge standard (D-2).<br/>The latter requires generally the installation of a certified ballast water treatment device, which enables sterilization avoiding transfers of ballast water mediated species.

	<div style="margin: 25px 25%; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
		Exemptions from this general requirement can be granted by country administrations under certain low risk conditions. In order to identify such low risk conditions a risk assessment (RA) should be carried out. IMO provides general guidance for such RA.<br/><br/>In semi enclosed seas like the Baltic and North Seas it is essential that the coastal countries specify such low risk conditions together in a harmonised and transparent way to ensure that the convention fulfils its aims.

	<div style="font-weight: bold; margin: 25px 25%; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> A joint regional approach on exemptions to supplement IMO is available </div>
	<div style="margin: 25px 25%; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
		The agreed approach is fully in line with IMO guidance (see Exemptions and Target species for further information). The outcome of the approach is a categorization to High and Low risk routes which will then be the basis for further national deliberation and final decision.<br/><br/>The countries who have agreed to this approach within HELCOM include Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Sweden and Russia.<br/>The countries who have agreed to this approach within OSPAR include Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Also, the European Union is a member of both HELCOM and OSPAR.
